# Horiseon Accessibility Update: Challenge 1
 
## Making the Horiseon Homepage more accessible.
 
The goal was to make the Horiseon homepage more accessible to everyone. Alt attributes were added to all images and icons so users who require screen readers or if images fail to load, the content of the image is still be conveyed. Also ensured that all links were working as expected. Redundancies in the CSS page have also been removed to make for an easier to read page.
